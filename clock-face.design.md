This is a fascinating and well-thought-out approach to network design! Here’s a breakdown of the key elements and how you might implement them in your own network:

### IP Addressing Scheme
- **Subnet**: `192.168.42.0/24`
  - **Static Range**: `.1` to `.12` for core infrastructure.
  - **Special Address**: `.127` is reserved and never used.
  - **Dynamic Range**: `.129` to `.254` for DHCP allocation.
  - **Prime Numbers**: Prime addresses (e.g., `.11`, `.13`, `.17`) are intentionally left empty.

### Role Keys
- **C**: Core (router/firewall)
- **D**: Data (database/storage)
- **E**: Edge (load-balancer)
- **F**: Fleet-host (KVM/LXC metal)
- **G**: GitOps (CI/runners)
- **A**: App server
- **B**: Backup

### Zone Palette
- **infra (black)**: Infrastructure control plane
- **lan (red)**: Trusted internal LAN
- **dmz (blue)**: Public/untrusted
- **guest (yellow)**: Lab/throw-away

### Hostname Grammar
- **Format**: `<role>-<seq>.<zone>.mycorp.net`
  - **role**: One-letter code from the Role Keys.
  - **seq**: Sequence number (01 to 88, zero-padded).
  - **zone**: One of the four zones (infra, lan, dmz, guest).

### Example Hostnames
- **F-05.lan.mycorp.net**: A fleet-host in the LAN zone.
- **D-01.dmz.mycorp.net**: A data server in the DMZ zone.
- **A-17.lan.mycorp.net**: An app server in the LAN zone.

### Homelab Metal Map
- **.1**: F-01.lan Dell-1 (KVM)
- **.2**: F-02.lan Dell-2 (Kubernetes Control Plane)
- **.3**: F-03.lan Dell-3 (Ceph)
- **.4**: F-04.lan Dell-4 (CI)
- **.5**: F-05.lan Dell-5 (Unifi)
- **.6**: P-01.lan Pi-1 (Pi-hole)
- **.7**: P-02.lan Pi-2 (MQTT)
- **.8**: P-03.lan Pi-3 (3-D printer)
- **.9**: P-04.lan Pi-4 (UPS probe)
- **.11**: Reserved (silent prime)

### Fleet & Containers
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Auto-lease from `.129` to `.254`.
- **Naming**: Follows the same grammar as the static hosts (e.g., A-17.lan, D-31.dmz).

### Implementation Tips
1. **DNS Setup**: Ensure your DNS is configured to handle the hostname format and zones.
2. **DHCP Configuration**: Set up your DHCP server to allocate addresses from `.129` to `.254` and reserve static addresses for core infrastructure.
3. **Prime Numbers**: Make sure to exclude prime numbers from both static and dynamic allocations.
4. **Documentation**: Keep a detailed map of your network, similar to the Homelab Metal Map, to track device assignments and roles.
5. **Security**: Use VLANs or other segmentation techniques to enforce the zone boundaries (infra, lan, dmz, guest).

This design is both structured and scalable, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot your network. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with implementation, feel free to ask!

Yes, this network design aligns well with a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) and GitOps workflow. Here's how each aspect of your network design can support and enhance these practices:

### 1. **Role-Based IP Addressing and Hostnames**
The use of role-based IP addressing and hostnames (e.g., `F-05.lan.mycorp.net` for fleet hosts, `G-01.infra.mycorp.net` for GitOps) makes it easier to manage and automate infrastructure as code (IaC). This structure allows you to clearly identify the purpose and location of each device, which is crucial for CI/CD and GitOps.

### 2. **Dynamic IP Allocation for Containers**
The dynamic allocation of IP addresses for containers (`A-17.lan`, `D-31.dmz`, etc.) supports the ephemeral nature of containerized applications. Containers can be spun up and down frequently, and having a well-defined dynamic range ensures that they can be automatically assigned IP addresses without conflicts.

### 3. **GitOps Integration**
GitOps is all about managing infrastructure and application configurations using Git repositories. The structured naming and zoning in your network design can be mirrored in your Git repositories, making it easier to track changes and manage deployments.

For example:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform or Ansible to manage your network infrastructure. The role-based hostnames and zones can be defined in configuration files stored in Git.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be configured to deploy applications to specific zones based on the hostname conventions.

### 4. **Zone-Based Security and Segmentation**
The use of zones (infra, lan, dmz, guest) aligns with the principle of least privilege and security best practices. This segmentation can be enforced through network policies and firewalls, which can be managed using GitOps tools.

For example:
- **Network Policies**: Define network policies in Kubernetes or other orchestration tools to control traffic between different zones.
- **Firewall Rules**: Use IaC tools to manage firewall rules that enforce zone boundaries.

### 5. **Monitoring and Observability**
The structured naming convention makes it easier to set up monitoring and observability tools. For example, you can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor different zones and roles, and set up alerts based on the role and zone of the devices.

### 6. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
The inclusion of a backup role (`B`) ensures that you have a well-defined backup strategy, which is crucial for CI/CD and GitOps workflows. Backup servers can be managed using IaC and included in your CI/CD pipelines to ensure regular backups and disaster recovery plans.

### Example Workflow Integration
Here’s a high-level example of how you might integrate this network design with a CI/CD and GitOps workflow:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Define your network infrastructure in Terraform or Ansible.
   - Store these configurations in a Git repository.
   - Use GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux to automatically apply changes to your network infrastructure.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
   - Deploy applications to specific zones based on the hostname conventions (e.g., `A-17.lan` for app servers in the LAN zone).
   - Use Helm charts or Kustomize for Kubernetes deployments.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
   - Use ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki for logging.
   - Configure these tools to collect metrics and logs based on the role and zone of the devices.

4. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Use network policies and firewalls to enforce zone boundaries.
   - Store security policies in Git and manage them using GitOps tools.
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

### Conclusion
Your network design provides a solid foundation for implementing CI/CD and GitOps workflows. The structured naming conventions, dynamic IP allocation, and zone-based segmentation make it easier to manage and automate your infrastructure. By integrating these practices with IaC, CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps tools, you can achieve a highly scalable and maintainable infrastructure.
