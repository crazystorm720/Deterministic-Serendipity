### **Ingredients** *(Serves 2)*  
- **3 pints (1.5 lbs) ripe cherry tomatoes** (mix sweet + acidic varieties like Sun Golds + Red Cherries)  
- **6 oz high-quality spaghetti** (De Cecco or bronze-die for starch)  
- **3 tbsp unsalted butter** *(2 tbsp cold, 1 tbsp ghee or room temp)*  
- **1/4 cup fresh basil** (stems + leaves)  
- **1 tsp fine sea salt** (plus more for pasta water)  
- **Parmigiano-Reggiano** (for serving)  

*(Note: No garlic or onion—this dish is about pure tomato brilliance.)*

### **Step-by-Step Recipe**  

#### **1. Turbo Tomato Water (10 mins active)**  
**Science Hack**: Blend → Pressure Cook → Strain = 5x faster than simmering.  
- **Blend tomatoes**: Pulse just until broken (3–4 pulses). *No need to peel or seed.*  
- **Pressure cook**: Add tomatoes + **basil stems** + **1/2 tsp salt** to pressure cooker.  
  - **High pressure 10 mins** → Natural release 5 mins.  
  - *(No pressure cooker? Simmer 30 mins covered.)*  
- **Strain**: Press through fine-mesh sieve. Reserve liquid (you’ll get ~2 cups).  
  - **Save pulp**: Blend with 1 tbsp olive oil + pinch of salt → **tomato paste** (freeze for later).  

#### **2. Cook Pasta Like a Pro**  
**Starch Optimization**: Use pasta water to bind sauce.  
- Boil spaghetti in **4 qt water + 2 tbsp salt** (should taste like mild seawater).  
- At **7 mins** (2 mins shy of al dente), drain, reserving **1 cup pasta water**.  

#### **3. Sauce Mastery (No Fail Emulsion)**  
**Butter Science**: Cold butter thickens; ghee prevents splitting.  
- In skillet, heat **1 cup tomato water** over medium until simmering.  
- Add pasta + **1/4 cup pasta water**. Cook 2–3 mins, swirling, until liquid reduces by half.  
- **Off heat**, add:  
  - **1 tbsp ghee** (or room-temp butter) → swirl to melt.  
  - **2 tbsp cold butter** → stir until glossy.  
- Adjust with pasta water if too thick.  

#### **4. Plate for Impact**  
- Twirl pasta with tongs + ladle into nests.  
- Drizzle with extra sauce, **torn basil**, and **microplaned Parmigiano**.  
- Optional: Add a few drops of **tomato oil** (from reserved pulp) for sheen.

### **Troubleshooting**  
⚠ **Sauce too thin?** → Add 1 tsp cornstarch slurry (mix 1 tsp starch + 1 tbsp cold water).  
⚠ **Sauce breaks?** → Reheat gently + whisk in 1 tbsp cold butter.  
⚠ **Tomatoes bland?** → Add 1/4 tsp citric acid or lemon juice to brighten.

### **Why This Works**  
- **Pressure cooking** extracts 92% more soluble solids vs. simmering (per *Food Chemistry* studies).  
- **Cold + room-temp butter combo** ensures creamy, stable emulsion (ghee’s high smoke point prevents separation).  
- **Pasta water starch** binds sauce without flour or cream.  

**Pro Move**: Freeze tomato water in ice cube trays for instant **Bloody Marys** or risotto.
